# Customer-churn-prediction
Customer Churn Prediction This project predicts customer churn using a Kaggle dataset. It involves EDA, feature engineering, and machine learning models to identify at-risk customers. The goal is to provide insights for retention strategies by comparing model performance and extracting key patterns.
This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains customer details, usage behavior, and churn status. The goal is to analyze factors influencing churn and develop a predictive model.  

## **Dataset Overview**  

The dataset includes various customer attributes, service usage patterns, and churn labels. Below are the key columns:  

| Column Name         | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **CustomerID**       | Unique identifier for each customer. |
| **Age**             | Age of the customer. |
| **Gender**          | Customer‚Äôs gender (Male/Female). |
| **Tenure**          | Number of months the customer has been with the service. |
| **Usage Frequency** | How often the customer uses the service. |
| **Support Calls**   | Number of support calls made by the customer. |
| **Payment Delay**   | Number of delayed payments. |
| **Subscription Type** | Type of subscription plan (e.g., Basic, Premium). |
| **Contract Length**  | Duration of the contract (e.g., Monthly, Yearly). |
| **Total Spend**     | Total amount spent by the customer. |
| **Last Interaction** | The last recorded interaction with the service. |
| **Churn**           | Whether the customer churned (Yes/No). |

## **Project Goals**
